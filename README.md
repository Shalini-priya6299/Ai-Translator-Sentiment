# Multilingual AI Translator
This project is a simple and interactive multilingual AI-based translator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It supports multiple languages, detects sentiment, and translates text in real time. The interface includes emojis, language selection menus, a clean layout, and a smooth user experience. The project is designed to be lightweight, responsive, and easy to use for anyone who wants quick translations or emotional tone detection.

## Features
The translator supports a wide range of languages. It automatically processes the input text and provides translated output instantly. It also includes sentiment detection that identifies the emotional tone of a sentence. The interface offers emoji reactions based on sentiment and includes dark and light mode switching for user comfort.

## How It Works
The user enters text, selects the languages, and clicks the translate button. The script processes the text using the model API integrated in the JavaScript file. The result is displayed in the output box with translated text and sentiment indicator. Emojis are shown depending on the mood detected. The design is minimal, colorful, and easy to navigate.

## Project Structure
The project contains the main HTML file, CSS styling, JavaScript logic, and model integration. Buttons, selectors, text areas, and emoji sections are all connected through JavaScript. The code is organized for easy understanding and modification.

## Future Improvements
More languages can be added. The sentiment system can be upgraded. The UI can be expanded with voice input or text-to-speech. The overall speed can be increased with caching and model optimization.
